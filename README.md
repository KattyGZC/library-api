# Library API

Just hired you to create an online library. It needs you to build a REST API which will allow our clients to consume the list of available books, as well as to read those books page by page in the desired formats.

For this first iteration the books will be available (page by page) in plain text and HTML. In future iterations, we would like to add support for more reading formats, as well as support to interface with other online book service providers.  

## Technical Requirements 

- Get list of books
- Get a book
- Get a book page in the desired format
- Make use of friendly routes (for example: `/book/1` or `/book/1 /page/11/html`)
- Provide seeders / migrations for the database (books with their pages)
- Provide instruccions on project setup/configuration

## Rules
- Make use of the language mentioned in the email in which you got this test
- Do not use any frameworks. A good developer must know how to select his tools and how to use them.
- The use of third-party libraries is allowed and encouraged.
- Make use of .gitignore, keep it clean. 

## Instructions for execution
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a console.
3. Navigate to the project directory: cd library-api/
4. Run: python3 library_api/main.py
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ to use the application.
Note: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system before following the above steps.
